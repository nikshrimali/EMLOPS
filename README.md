# EMLOPS Assignment 1
### Tasks
- Change the train.py file to work with PyTorch
- Repeat the whole tutorial (Links to an external site.) again, but this time committing to GitHub.
- your data MUST not be there on GitHub, but only available to you locally
- when submitting, mention the accuracy of each model (trained twice, each time 10 epochs (or more)).
- You must publish metrics.csv file

### Test Cases
-  Add a test.py file that checks:
-  You have NOT uploaded data.zip (check where it is expected)
-  You have NOT uploaded model.h5 file (check where it is expected)
-  Your accuracy of the model is more than 70% (read from metrics)
-  The accuracy of your model for cat and dog is independently more than 70% (read from metrics.csv file)
